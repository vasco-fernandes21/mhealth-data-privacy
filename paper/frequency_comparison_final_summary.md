*Efficiency Score = F1-Score / (Training Time × Model Params / 1M)

## Recommendation: 32 Hz

### Why 32 Hz is Optimal:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Methods**: 
   - 50% faster training than 64Hz (7.2s vs 14.5s)
   - 49% fewer parameters than 64Hz (454K vs 884K)
   - Critical for DP-SGD and Federated Learning efficiency

2. **Signal Quality**:
   - Preserves ECG R-peaks for HRV analysis
   - Captures complete BVP waveform morphology
   - No aliasing artifacts in physiological bands

3. **Practical Deployment**:
   - Suitable for edge devices
   - Real-time processing capability
   - Balanced memory footprint

4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Only 1.8% F1-score reduction vs 64Hz
   - 2x computational savings
   - Best efficiency score (10.4)

## Technical Justification

### Signal Analysis:
- **ECG**: 32Hz preserves R-peak resolution (15Hz Nyquist limit)
- **BVP**: Captures pulse morphology without over-sampling noise
- **ACC**: Full movement dynamics preserved
- **EDA/TEMP**: Excellent resolution for slow physiological signals

### Computational Analysis:
- **Training Efficiency**: 32Hz provides 2x speedup over 64Hz
- **Memory Efficiency**: 49% parameter reduction vs 64Hz
- **Privacy Budget**: Lower computational cost = better privacy preservation

## Conclusion

32 Hz provides the optimal balance for privacy-preserving stress detection:
- **Performance**: 75.2% F1-score (excellent for clinical applications)
- **Efficiency**: Best computational efficiency for privacy methods
- **Quality**: Preserves all physiologically relevant signal components
- **Deployment**: Suitable for edge devices and real-time applications

The 1.8% performance reduction compared to 64Hz is negligible compared to the 2x computational savings, making 32Hz the practical choice for real-world privacy-preserving stress detection systems.
